# Module 21 Challenge

This is the repository for my module 21 challenge. In this module challenge, we defined a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin.  

In this challenge I created a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that is minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library. 

The crowdsale contract that I created manages the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. My contract mints the tokens automatically and distributes them to buyers in one transaction.

## Technologies

This is the smart contract code in the Solidity file:

```python
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

import "./KaseiCoin.sol";
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v2.5.0/contracts/crowdsale/Crowdsale.sol";
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v2.5.0/contracts/crowdsale/emission/MintedCrowdsale.sol";

contract KaseiCoinCrowdsale is Crowdsale, MintedCrowdsale {
    constructor(
        uint256 rate,
        address payable wallet,
        KaseiCoin token
    )
      Crowdsale(rate, wallet, token)
      public
    {
    
    }
}


contract KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer {
    address public kasei_token_address;
    address public kasei_crowdsale_address;

    constructor(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        address payable wallet
    ) public {
        // Create a new instance of the KaseiCoin contract.
        KaseiCoin token = new KaseiCoin(name, symbol, 0);
        
        // Assign the token contract’s address to the `kasei_token_address` variable.
        kasei_token_address = address(token);

        // Create a new instance of the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract
        KaseiCoinCrowdsale kasei_crowdsale =
            new KaseiCoinCrowdsale(1, wallet, token);
            
        // Aassign the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract’s address to the `kasei_crowdsale_address` variable.
        kasei_crowdsale_address = address(kasei_crowdsale);

        // Set the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract as a minter
        token.addMinter(kasei_crowdsale_address);
        
        // Have the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` renounce its minter role.
        token.renounceMinter();
    }
}
```

## Examples

#### This first shows the Remix IDE after we define the addresses for the joint account.

![define addresses](./Execution_Results/define_addresses.png)


#### In this image, we see the total Ether smart contract balance (in wei) after depositing 16 ether into the smart contract.

![ether](./Execution_Results/deposit_5_ether.png)


#### Here we see a transaction where we withdraw 10 ether into account 2.

#### This final image shows a list of the transactions in the Remix IDE.
